# Conclusion
Overall, our analysis suggests that COVID hit the movie industry especially hard and that it hasn’t recovered the way other industries have. Box office revenue, the number of theatrical releases, and the number of AMC theaters are all lower than before the pandemic. Stock performance tells a similar story. The movie index has only grown about 1.7× since 2019 while many sectors, especially tech, have doubled or more. One possible reason for this gap is that AI has boosted tech while also reshaping parts of the movie production pipeline, from animation to scriptwriting. Moreover, when we look inside the industry, we see that different types of firms follow very different paths. For example, streamers did very well during COVID, while theater chains remained the most volatile and struggled the most. However, this is still a rough picture because many companies spans across multiple segments. There are also some data limitations: we only see a small number of publicly traded firms in each sub-industry, and it’s very hard and time-consuming to build a clean, comparable panel data of streaming revenues for each company. A natural next step, if time and data allowed, would be to link these stock patterns more directly to company-level streaming and theatrical revenues to see how market performance lines up with business fundamentals.
