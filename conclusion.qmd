# Conclusion
Overall, our analysis shows that the movie industry has not recovered at the same pace as many other sectors since COVID-19. Box office revenue, the number of theatrical releases, and the number of AMC theaters are all lower than pre-pandemic levels. Stock performance tells a similar story: the movie index has only grown about 1.7× since 2019 while many sectors, especially tech, have doubled or more. One possible reason for this gap is that AI has boosted tech stock growth while also reshaping parts of the movie production pipeline, from animation to scriptwriting. The movie industry may be still adapting to this change and therefore lags behind other sectors.  

Within the movie industry, we see that different types of firms follow very different paths. For example, streamers did very well during COVID, while theater chains remained the most volatile and struggled the most. However, this is only a preliminary view and should be interpreted with caution given data limitations in this project. There are only a small number of publicly traded firms in each sub-industry. It’s also very difficult and time-consuming to build a clean, comparable dataset of revenue sources for each company. A natural next step, if time and data allowed, would be to link these stock patterns more directly to company-level financial data- e.g. comparing streaming and theatrical revenues to see how each company's stock performance lines up with business fundamentals.
