# Introduction
In this project, we examine how the movie industry has changed since COVID-19. We analyze both the operational side and the financial side (stock performance of publicly traded movie companies) of the movie industry to find trends/patterns. We further divided the movie industry into four sub-industries of theaters, studios, streaming platforms, and diversified media. Our goal is to answer questions such as: Are there structural changes within the movie industry since COVID-19? How do different parts of the industry respond to COVID-19–related shifts? Which sub-industries are most affected? By looking inside the movie industry itself and comparing the movie industry to other sectors of the market, we showcase how the industry evolved before, during, and after the pandemic.
