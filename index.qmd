# Introduction
We want to understand how COVID-19 reshaped the movie industry. Since the pandemic began, the movie industry has experienced theater closures, the rise of streaming, and widespread uncertainty. In this project, we explore these changes by analyzing both the operational side and the financial side (stock performance of publicly traded movie companies) of the movie industry. We further divided the movie industry into sub-industries of theaters, studios, streaming platforms, and diversified media. By looking inside the movie industry itself and comparing the movie industry to other sectors of the market, we showcase how the industry evolved before, during, and after the pandemic.
