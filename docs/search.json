    "text": "1 Introduction\nWe chose to examine the movie industry because it’s one of the examples of how COVID reshaped a major part of everyday life. Since COVID, theater closures, shifting release strategies, and the rise of streaming all created a period of uncertainty. This uncertainty affected everything from how many movies were released to how well different companies performed.\nIn this project, we explore these changes by looking at both box-office trends and the stock performance of theaters, studios, and streaming platforms, and by comparing the movie industry to other sectors of the market. Our goal is to give readers a sense of how the industry evolved before, during, and after the pandemic, and to highlight the broader forces—technological, cultural, and economic—that continue to influence how audiences watch movies today.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nOur project uses three datasets that draw on two sources of data. The first dataset comes from Box Office Mojo, which reports domestic box office performance based on revenue submitted by studios and theater chains (https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/?ref_=bo_nb_di_secondarytab). We scraped the site’s annual summary table using pandas.read_html(), which includes total box office, year-over-year percent change, number of releases, and the highest-grossing film for each year. The full scraping workflow is documented in data-raw/movie-boxoffice.ipynb.\nThe second dataset is made up of stock prices of publicly traded movie-industry companies from the year 2019-01-01 to 2025-11-30. We pulled the data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance package. Our movie-industry companies include major theater chains (AMC, CNK, IMAX), legacy studios (Disney, Comcast, Paramount/Sky, Warner Bros. Discovery, Fox), streaming platforms (Netflix, Roku), and diversified media (SONY). We also added the S&P 500 index for benchmarking. Yahoo Finance provides daily open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume data, which we used to compute returns, volatility, and drawdowns. The full code for downloading and transforming this dataset is in data-raw/movie-stocks.ipynb.\nThe third dataset extends the financial view by pulling data on a few broad sector ETFs from Yahoo Finance, allowing us to compare movie-industry companies to the overall market and other major sectors. This data was also downloaded and cleaned in data-raw/movie-stocks.ipynb.\nAll datasets were collected and ran through Jupyter Notebooks stored in the data-raw/ folder. We exported these datasets as cleaned csv in the data folder to ensure reproducibility. The main limitations are that Box Office Mojo occasionally changes its HTML structure, and Yahoo Finance’s API can return missing values, but both sources are widely used and generally reliable for exploratory analysis.\nthings to work on 12/7/25: - think of a few other charts: - alluvial diagram of movies distributed in theaters vs. streaming? - movies released by different distributors - compare netflix revenue to other companies?",
