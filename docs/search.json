    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn this project, we examine how the movie industry has changed since COVID-19. We analyze both the operational side and the financial side (stock performance of publicly traded movie companies) of the movie industry to find trends/patterns. We further divided the movie industry into four sub-industries of theaters, studios, streaming platforms, and diversified media. Our goal is to answer questions such as: Are there structural changes within the movie industry since COVID-19? How do different parts of the industry respond to COVID-19–related shifts? Which sub-industries are most affected? By looking inside the movie industry itself and comparing the movie industry to other sectors of the market, we showcase how the industry evolved before, during, and after the pandemic.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe first dataset comes from Box Office Mojo, which reports annual domestic box office revenue and number of releases submitted by studios and theaters. Our full scraping workflow is documented in data-raw/movie-boxoffice.ipynb. The table is updated once per year and contains roughly one row per available year from 2015- 2025 (10 rows x 6 columns).\nThe second dataset is made up of stock prices of publicly traded movie-industry companies from the year 2019-01-01 to 2025-11-30. We pulled the data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance package. We selected movie-industry companies including major theater chains (AMC, CNK, IMAX), legacy studios (Disney, Comcast, Paramount/Sky, Warner Bros. Discovery, Fox), streaming platforms (Netflix, Roku), and diversified media (SONY). We also added the S&P 500 index for benchmarking. Yahoo Finance provides daily open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume data, which we used to compute returns, volatility, and drawdowns. The full code for downloading and transforming this dataset is in data-raw/movie-stocks.ipynb. This dataset has 20856 rows and 13 columns.\nThe third dataset pulls data on a few broad sector ETFs from Yahoo Finance, allowing us to compare movie-industry companies to the overall market and other major sectors. This data was also downloaded and cleaned in data-raw/movie-stocks.ipynb. Yfinance updates the stock prices each trading day. This dataset has 12166 rows and 13 columns.\nThese three datasets were collected and ran through Jupyter Notebooks stored in the /data-raw folder. We exported these datasets as cleaned csv in the data folder to ensure reproducibility. The main limitations are that Box Office Mojo occasionally changes its HTML structure, and Yahoo Finance’s API can return missing values, but both sources are generally reliable.\nA fourth dataset comes from AMC’s “U.S. Markets – Theatres & Screens” tables for 2019 and 2024. We copied these tables from AMC’s 10-K filings on its investor relations site (2019 10-K and 2024 10-K) and manually cleaned them in Excel into two files (AMC_theatres_screens_by_market_2019.xlsx and AMC_theatres_screens_by_market_2024.xlsx). We used these tables to compare AMC’s closure of theatres by state before and after COVID and to build the choropleth map in Section 1. The table has one row per U.S. state and columns for theatre and screen counts; these filings are updated annually.",

    "section": "2.2 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nAcross our datasets, missingness is minimal. In the movie/media prices data, nearly all fields are complete; only the engineered features show gaps- about 2% of rows are missing vol_21d, and a smaller share (around 0.2%) are missing return values. For the columns with missing values, such as Volume or Close, the missingness plot indicates that these mostly show up together. This implies that an entire daily price was absent for a small number of dates.\nFor the sector ETF data, the story is very similar. All of the core price and identifier columns are complete. The only missing values show up in vol_21d and a few return entries. So during the analysis and graphing, it’s reasonable to either drop these rows.\nThe box-office dataset contains no missing values.\nFor the AMC “U.S. Markets – Theatres & Screens” tables (2019 and 2024), we initially observed seven states without computed 2019–2024 changes. When we investigated, we learned that four of these states—Vermont, Mississippi, Maine, and Rhode Island—have never had AMC theatres, so they don’t show up in either year’s table. The remaining three states—Delaware, Wyoming, and New Hampshire—each had one AMC theatre in 2019 but none in 2024, so they were omitted from the 2024 file even though they should appear with a value of 0 theatres. We manually added zeros for these states to represent their 2024 counts accurately. After this correction, the missingness plot shows no missing values; the four states with no AMC presence simply do not appear in the underlying 10-K data because AMC does not operate theatres there.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(redav)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(patchwork)   \n\n# --- Load data ---\nmedia &lt;- read_csv(\"data/movie_media_clean.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date))\n\nsectors &lt;- read_csv(\"data/sector_etfs_clean.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date))\n\nbox_office &lt;- read_csv(\"data/box_office.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\namc_2019_raw &lt;- read_excel(\"data/AMC_theatres_screens_by_market_2019.xlsx\")\namc_2024_raw &lt;- read_excel(\"data/AMC_theatres_screens_by_market_2024.xlsx\")\n\n# helper: make a nice missingness plot with centered title ---------------\nmake_missing_plot &lt;- function(dat, title_text) {\n  p &lt;- plot_missing(dat, num_char = 4)\n\n  # remove the internal \"Missing Values\" panel title\n  p_clean &lt;- p & theme(plot.title = element_blank())\n\n  # add a global, centered title\n  p_clean + plot_annotation(\n    title = title_text,\n    theme = theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(\n        hjust  = 0.5,          # center\n        face   = \"bold\",\n        size   = 14,\n        margin = margin(b = 6) # little padding under the title\n      )\n    )\n  )\n}\n\n# --- Missingness plots -------------------------\nmake_missing_plot(media,       \"Missing Values – Movie/Media Prices\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmake_missing_plot(sectors,     \"Missing Values – Sector ETF Data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmake_missing_plot(box_office,  \"Missing Values – Box Office Data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmake_missing_plot(amc_2019_raw,\"Missing Values – AMC Theatres & Screens (2019)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmake_missing_plot(amc_2024_raw,\"Missing Values – AMC Theatres & Screens (2024)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# sectors\nmissing_summary_sectors &lt;- sectors |&gt;\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ mean(is.na(.)))) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(),\n               names_to = \"variable\",\n               values_to = \"prop_missing\")\n\n# media\nmissing_summary_media &lt;- media |&gt;\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ mean(is.na(.)))) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(),\n               names_to = \"variable\",\n               values_to = \"prop_missing\")\n\n# box office\nmissing_summary_box &lt;- box_office |&gt;\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ mean(is.na(.)))) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(),\n               names_to = \"variable\",\n               values_to = \"prop_missing\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmissing_summary_sectors &lt;- sectors |&gt;\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ mean(is.na(.)))) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(),\n               names_to = \"variable\",\n               values_to = \"prop_missing\")\n\nggplot(missing_summary_sectors,\n       aes(x = fct_reorder(variable, prop_missing),\n           y = prop_missing)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n  labels = percent_format(accuracy = 0.1),\n  breaks = c(0, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01)  # adjust as you like\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percent of Missing Values by Variable (Sector ETFs)\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"% of rows missing\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n## Movie/media missingness\nggplot(missing_summary_media,\n       aes(x = fct_reorder(variable, prop_missing),\n           y = prop_missing)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n  labels = percent_format(accuracy = 0.1),\n  breaks = c(0, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01)  \n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percent of Missing Values by Variable (Movie/Media)\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"% of rows missing\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)",

Only a few states show growth, such as Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, California, and New York, and many light grey states have no changes.

For example, Roku’s share price rose sharply in 2020, corresponding to higher streaming usage during stay-at-home period. AMC experienced large price swings in early 2021. This was due to the “meme-stock” trading frenzy driven by movements from the reddit group wallstreetbets. These movements stood out from the rest of the movie industry. However, in 2022, both ROKU and AMC stocks trended downward- revealing these were temporary movements rather than lasting increase.\n\n\n3.2.3 Chart 6.

We now look inside the movie industry. Different types of companies in the industry, such as streamers, theater, studios, and diversified media firms, may not move in the same way. In this section, we break the movie industry into these sub-industries to see how each one has evolved.\n\n3.3.1 Chart 7. Faceted Sub-Industry in Movie Industry Performance\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

Theater companies experienced a steep drop in stock price in 2020 followed by an uneven recovery. Streamers rise sharply through 2020–2021 before dropping significantly in 2022. Diversified media firms trend more steadily upward, while studios show a mild, gradual decline.\n\n\n3.3.2 Chart 8.

Studios and theaters are moderately linked (0.66), and streamers and studios also track each other pretty well (0.74). Theaters are the real outlier here, as their prices move much less in sync with the rest of the industry. This suggests that theater companies mayreact to a different set of forces than streaming or diversified media firms.\n\n\n3.3.3 Chart 9.

Benchmark and diversified firms have the tightest, tallest curves, so their daily returns usually stay close to zero. Studio stocks sit in the middle. Streamers have fatter tails, meaning they have bigger fluctuations more often. And again, theater stocks are the most volatile of all, with the widest distribution and most frequent large positive and negative returns.\n\n\n3.3.4 Chart 10.

    "text": "Overall, our analysis shows that the movie industry has not recovered at the same pace as many other sectors since COVID-19. Box office revenue, the number of theatrical releases, and the number of AMC theaters are all lower than pre-pandemic levels. Stock performance tells a similar story: the movie index has only grown about 1.7× since 2019 while many sectors, especially tech, have doubled or more. One possible reason for this gap is that AI has boosted tech stock growth while also reshaping parts of the movie production pipeline, from animation to scriptwriting. The movie industry may be still adapting to this change and therefore lags behind other sectors.\nWithin the movie industry, we see that different types of firms follow very different paths. For example, streamers did very well during COVID, while theater chains remained the most volatile and struggled the most. However, this is only a preliminary view and should be interpreted with caution given data limitations in this project. There are only a small number of publicly traded firms in each sub-industry. It’s also very difficult and time-consuming to build a clean, comparable dataset of revenue sources for each company. A natural next step, if time and data allowed, would be to link these stock patterns more directly to company-level financial data- e.g. comparing streaming and theatrical revenues to see how each company’s stock performance lines up with business fundamentals.",
